# fmaker-python
Experimental short script i made for UNIX systems.

And that's pretty much it. 
It's a workspace maker written in python for linux, it creates some folders under the name you put in and tells you when it's done.

As of right now since it is experimental it only lets you choose the name of the main folder and it automagically creates some folders in it.

Folder names right now are only related to web development because that's what i do, but i intend to make it a full blown workspace maker with several organization modes such as web development with a js, css and html folders, python script development with folders for modules and fancy stuff, graph design with folders for photograph, icons, fonts and such and many more.
